      <h1>Experienced songwriter records original song for the first time</h1>
      <p>Lyric Green, an MU student studying psychology, chose to take a music
composition class during her second to last semester of college. While she has played guitar
since her junior year of high school and written many original songs over the years, she had no
experience with production prior to enrolling in the class. One of her assignments was to write a
song and record it using Logic Pro recording software to turn in for credit. She wrote and
recorded almost the entire song on the weekend of Nov. 12 at Central House in Columbia. This
was Green’s first time recording one of her original songs, titled “Say it Again.”

music composition class on Saturday, Nov. 12, 2022. “I
think it’s fun (writing lyrics) at first, but then I lose interest
because it’s hard,” Green said. “So I have to come back
every once in a while.”</figcaption>

chords on her guitar on Saturday, Nov. 12, 2022. “In high
school, I met these two girls who helped me with the
courage to perform in front of people,” Green said.
“They’re also how I got into guitar, and the interest just
grew from there.”</figcaption>

Nov. 13, 2022. “I’m okay with (the software). I think I’m
doing better than what I thought I’d be able to do,
honestly,” Green said. “I was really happy to start trying
to make music when I joined. Now I’m losing motivation.”</figcaption>

turning it in anyway because it needs to be turned in.”</figcaption>
