      <h1>Six great ramen places in downtown Columbia</h1>
      <p>Now that the temperature is dropping in Columbia, it might be a good idea to check out some local restaurants that serve warm, steaming bowls of ramen. Classic Japanese-style ramen noodle soup includes a range of ingredients, but the most essential are ramen noodles, stock, scallions, and seasoned soft-boiled eggs, among many other ingredients. These six delicious options are all available for patrons ready to get something warm and tasty in their bellies, and they’re all conveniently located downtown!</p>

					<p>This stylistic restaurant recently under new management features a dish that is not a traditional ramen bowl, as it has rice noodles instead of the traditional ramen noodles. They also add jalapeños and raw carrots, which also stray from tradition but a little extra vegetables and spice never hurt anyone!</p>
