      <h1>The Harry Potter Books: Worst to Best</h1>
      <p>As a major Harry Potter fan who's read the books countless times, I decided to rank them in order of my least favorite to favorite book.</p>

      <section class="media-holder">
        <div class="image-holder">

        <div class="text-holder">
          <h2>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</h2>
          <p>By J.K. Rowling</p>
          <p>Although it's my least favorite, I still enjoyed this book. It introduced the first horcrux, so I'll give it props for that. However, this wasn't enough to rank it any higher.</p>

        <div class="text-holder">
          <h2>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</h2>
          <p>By J.K. Rowling</p>
          <p>I didn't want to rank the first book last, because the introduction to the wizarding world is always fun to read. It only gets better as the series goes on, though.</p>

        <div class="text-holder">
          <h2>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</h2>
          <p>By J.K. Rowling</p>
          <p>Everyone seems to dislike this book because it's "boring." I disagree, but not enough to rank it any higher.</p>

        <div class="text-holder">
          <h2>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</h2>
          <p>By J.K. Rowling</p>
          <p>Things got real in this book, and I probably read it in one night. If asked on a different day, I might have ranked it even higher, who knows?</p>

          <h2>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</h2>

          <p>The book that introduces Sirius Black will always be in the top three.</p>

          <h2>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</h2>
          <p>By J.K. Rowling</p>
          <p>This book was simply just exciting. The Quidditch World Cup, Triwizard Tournament and the return of Voldemort all in the same year? It's almost too much. Almost.</p>

          <p>Maybe it's basic to rank the last book as the best one, but I don't care. It was really, really, really good.</p>
